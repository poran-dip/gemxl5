"""Results CSVs: merge new rows into an existing file instead of overwriting it.

Rerunning one workload replaces only that workload's earlier rows (matched on `key` columns);
everything else in the file is kept. Files are written after every run so an interrupted sweep
keeps what it measured, and are handed back to the invoking user when run under sudo.
