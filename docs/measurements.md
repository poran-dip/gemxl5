# Measurements

Maps each measurement required by the project spec to the CSV columns that report it, where the
number comes from, and what it does and does not mean. Code: `gemxl/`. Sweeps:
`configs/sweep.py` (gem5, writes `results/gem5_sweep.csv`) and `native/sweep_ram.py` (real
machine, writes `ram_sweep.csv`).

**Blank vs 0.** A blank cell means that counter is unavailable or the run did not get that far.
`0` means it was measured and nothing happened.

| Application execution time            | `sim_sec`                                                                                    | `wall_sec`, `roi_sec`                                                                                                               | gem5: simulated seconds of the ROI (from `stats.txt`). Never compare gem5 and native seconds directly.                                                                                                                                                              |

The unit differs per workload (stream/kvdecode bytes, chase hops, gemm flops, sort compares), so compare a workload only with itself.                                                                                                   |

Native IPC needs `perf stat` and is not collected yet.                                                                                                                                                                                 |

It is the DRAM-side latency, not what the CPU sees. `ns_per_work` for `chase` is the end-to-end latency and the number to validate the tier against.                                                                 |

Native: page allocations by the Linux allocator, not accesses (4 KiB pages).                                                                                                                                        |

Blank when the kernel lacks the counter. Becomes available in gem5 full-system mode.                                                                                                         |

Excludes protocol and transaction overhead until the link itself is modeled. 0 until a slow tier exists.                                                                                              |
| CPU utilization                       | `cpu_busy_frac`                                                                              | `user_sec`, `sys_sec`, `cpu_util`                                                                                                   | Native `cpu_util = (user + sys) / wall`; it drops when the process blocks on swap. gem5 `cpu_busy_frac` only appears if the CPU model exposes `idleCycles`. In SE mode a single thread is never idle, so expect about 1. It becomes meaningful in full-system mode. |

## Conventions

- **Slow tier detection.** A gem5 memory controller whose stat path matches `--slow-pattern`
  (default `slow|cxl|pcie`) is counted as the slow tier. Name the second tier's controller
  accordingly when the two-tier config is written. Everything else is the fast tier.
- **Raw stats kept.** Every gem5 run also writes `roi_stats.json` (all ROI stats) next to
  `stats.txt`, so a new metric can be added later with `--reparse` and no re-simulation.
- **System-wide counters.** The Linux counters cover the whole machine, so run native sweeps on
  an otherwise idle system.

## Not covered yet

- Native IPC (`perf stat`).
- ROI-only Linux counters. Today they span allocation plus ROI, which is where spill, swap and
  migration mostly happen anyway.
- The slow tier, full-system Linux, swap device, and the PCIe link model. Those columns exist
  but stay blank or 0 until the corresponding piece is built.
